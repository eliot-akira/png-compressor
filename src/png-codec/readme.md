# @lunapaint/png-codec

This is a PNG decoder and encoder library for JavaScript that runs in both the browser and in Node.js. It is used in [Luna Paint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.luna-paint) (an image editor for VS Code) to work with PNG files.

You can try it out on [`vscode.dev`](https://vscode.dev/) by installing the Luna Paint extension and opening a png file.

## Features

- **Performance**: Just like Luna Paint, performance is a priority. This includes code splitting such that code that parses optional chunks are only loaded as needed.
- **Correctness**: The library has > 97% code coverage via over 7500 tests, including full coverage of [PngSuite](https://github.com/lunapaint/pngsuite)â€”the "official" test suite for PNG.
- **Simple API**: The API is a well documented [TypeScript declaration file](https://github.dev/lunapaint/png-codec/blob/main/typings/api.d.ts).
- **Metadata**: All supported metadata is exposed on the API such as text, gamma, default background color, etc.
- **Readable Codebase**: A big part of this was a learning exercise for me so I put some effort in to make the code as readable as possible to help others on the same journey.
- **Error tolerant**: Images will still load with warnings unless a critical error is hit.

## Install

The supported way of installing the project is through npm:

```
npm install @lunapaint/png-codec
```

Alternatively, you could add the repo as a git submodule, or download the source from the GitHub [releases page](https://github.com/lunapaint/png-codec/releases).

## API

Basic usage:

```ts
import { decodePng, encodePng } from '@lunapaint/png-codec'
import * as fs from 'fs/promises'

async function decode(filepath) {
  const data = await fs.readFile(filepath)
  const decoded = await decodePng(data)
  console.log('decoded image', decoded.image.data)
  // [r, g, b, a, ...]
}

async function encode(data, width, height, filepath) {
  const encoded = await encodePng({ data, width, height })
  await fs.writeFile(filepath, encoded.data)
  console.log('encoded image', encoded.data)
  // [...binary data]
}
```

The full API is documented as a TypeScript `.d.ts` declaration file. The view the API:

- [github.dev](https://github.dev/lunapaint/png-codec/blob/main/typings/api.d.ts): View on the web in VS Code, which has symbol support out of the box. Try showing the Outline view and triggering the `Go to Symbol in Editor` command
- [github.com](https://github.com/lunapaint/png-codec/blob/main/typings/api.d.ts): View the raw file in github.com.

## Decoder chunk support

PNGs are made up of a fixed signature followed by a series of chunks. The following chunks can be decoded supported, with some notes provided where applicable:

**Critical chunks:**

| Chunk  | Name          | Notes                                                                                     |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [IHDR] | Image header  |
| [PLTE] | Palette       |
| [IDAT] | Image data    | Full filtering and interlacing support for all bit depths (1, 2, 4, 8, 16) are supported. |
| [IEND] | Image trailer |

**Ancillary chunks:**

| Chunk  | Name                                   | Notes                                                                                                                               |

| [gAMA] | Image gamma                            | Gamma values are provided, but are not applied to the resulting image (see [#11](https://github.com/lunapaint/png-codec/issues/11)) |
| [hIST] | Image histogram                        |
| [iCCP] | Embedded ICC profile                   | Exposes the profile as a byte array                                                                                                 |

| [pHYs] | Physical pixel dimensions              |
| [sBIT] | Significant bits                       | Since the decoded buffer uses a minimum of uint8, this is only when the significant bits are in the range of 9-15                   |

| [tRNS] | Transparency                           | Since this chunk modifies the resulting image, you cannot skip this chunk                                                           |
| [zTXt] | Compressed textual data                |

## Why does this exist?

These are the main reasons:

- To deeply understand the format.
- To integrate better with Luna Paint and my other existing and future decoders that depend on the png format.
- The scope is limited, this project will eventually be "done" and need minimal maintenance.
- I didn't want to go the wasm route in Luna Paint (yet?).
- To have full control over how the code is loaded, for example Luna Paint uses dynamic imports extensively to reduce the amount of code loaded to combat slow startup times.
- As an educational resource.
- To have some fun.

## Dependencies

The library has the single runtime dependency [pako](https://github.com/nodeca/pako) which provides the compression/decompression capabilities needed to read various png chunks.
