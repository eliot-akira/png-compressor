## Why

It can be useful to encode data, such as application state, into an image file that can be shared easily, for example, compared to exporting JSON or ZIP file.

## How

The data is `gzip` compressed using the [Compression Streams API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Compression_Streams_API), well-supported by browsers. The PNG format uses the same algorithm, but I found that the compression ratio is dramatically better when the data is compressed before encoding as image.

Each byte of the given data is written into the color channels (red/green/blue) of a canvas. The opacity (alpha) channel is not used because it can change color values. The canvas is then exported as a [Blob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob), which can then be turned into an image element or downloaded as a PNG file.

## Install

```sh
npm install --save png-compressor
```

## Usage

### Encode/decode JSON-serializable value

```ts
import { encode, decode } from 'png-compressor'

const object = { key: 'value' }

const pngImage = await encode(object)
const decoded =  await decode(pngImage)

assert.deepEqual(decoded, object)
```

### Encode/decode binary (array buffer)

```ts
import { encodeBinary, decodeBinary } from 'png-compressor'

const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(8)

const pngImage = await encodeBinary(buffer)
const decoded =  await decodeBinary(pngImage)

assert.deepEqual(decoded, buffer)
```

### Create image element

```ts
import { encodeToImage } from 'png-compressor'

const object = { key: 'value' }

const image = await encodeToImage(object)
```

Or pass an image element as second argument to render into it.

```ts
const image = document.createElement('img')

await encodeToImage(object, image)
```

### Download as image

```ts
import { encodeToBlob, downloadImage } from 'png-compressor'

const blob = await encodeToBlob(object)

downloadImage(blob, 'example.png')
```
